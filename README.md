you can determine your cardâ€™s WiFi version:

   | WiFi Standard | PHY Mode                   |
   |---------------|----------------------------|
   | WiFi 4        | `HT` (802.11n)             |
   | WiFi 5        | `VHT` (802.11ac)           |
   | WiFi 6        | `HE` (802.11ax)            |
   | WiFi 6E       | `HE` (with 6 GHz channels) |
